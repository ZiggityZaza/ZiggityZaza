I can’t bear this misery any longer. I’ve done everything I could, but it’s never enough—it never is. Yet, I keep moving forward, pushing through this tunnel. There’s no escape, no solution, no guide. I’m destined to carry this headache until my final rest.

Tonight, I stain my hands once more, embracing this burden as my own. I carry it with me, step by step. I look down to see that I am still standing, driven by my [desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9wsRRlTL3s) to live.
